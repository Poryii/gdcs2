# 1: Features

The **Reset Trigger** {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Triggers/Reset.png" class="emote">}} is useful in platformer mode if you want to __reuse a checkpoint or collectable that has been picked up by the player.__ In order to reset these, you need to have them on a group ID that matches the ID used in the reset trigger.

The example below has a checkpoint and six coin collectables assigned to group ID `1`. Touching the reset trigger resets everything under that group ID.

The Reset trigger also works on breakable blocks too.
