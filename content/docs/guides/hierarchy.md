current content. Will be fleshed out but just wanted to actually make the guide here first.
{{< callout context="note" title="TLDR - What this guide covers" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}

* Decoration is made of multiple components, such as shape and color.
* These components are the building blocks of any decoration, so it's important to know what they are and how to use them.
* One crucial use for deco component is hierarchy*, which determines how "important" a deco element feels.

* If you're newer to creating, it is highly recommended* that you learn what's in the Beginner and Intermediate guides first.
* Of course, we can't stop you from reading ahead, but you may struggle to apply the concepts in these guides while also learning to create.

# 1: Deco Elements

The most fundamental parts of any decoration are the **elements of deco**. These are so fundamental that **you can't make decoration without them**. For example, if you don't have shapes, your deco will just be a single blob of color, and without color you won't be able to see shapes anyway.
The components of deco are as follows.


`note: each of these needs images to go with them for this guide.`

* **Color:** The hue and saturation you give an object. This is one of the most clear ways to distinguish objects, since human eyes can distinguish a broad range of hues. Without color, you don't have any of the other design elements, since there's no way to distinguish them.
* **Value:** The brightness/darkness an object has. While this is technically part of color, human eyes are especially sensitive to value. This makes mastering value a crucial part of decoration.
* **Line:** A connection between two points in space. Lines can have varying thickness and be implied (for instance, ellipses like these make a line .........). Lines can be straight or curved, and are usually distinguished by using color and/or value.
* **Shape:** The 2-dimensional area an object has. Shapes are usually distinguished with one of the three elements above (color, value, or lines). There are many types of shapes, and alongside color they're one of the main ways to distinguish objects.
* **Form:** The 3-dimensional area an object has. Since we're working with a 2D game, this is usually an illusion of depth. You can make objects appear to be 3D using perspective, overlapping objects, and color tricks.
* **Space:** The area between and inside shapes. This can be positive space, such as the space taken up by objects, or negative space which is between objects. Both types of space are important to consider, especially for visual effects and transitions.
* **Texture:** The material an object has or appears to have. Since we're not working with real objects, this is also implied like form. You can make objects appear to have texture by using lighting and colors.

# \# 2: Contrast & Hierarchy

While it's important to know what elements make up deco, it's equally (or even more) important to know about **contrast**. Put simply, this is the difference between two objects. Contrast is the reason why you can see, distinguish objects from each other, and so on; so knowing how to manipulate it is crucial for deco.
For decoration, these differences will be based on the elements of deco described above. A red object differs from a blue object because of color, while a circle contrasts with a square because of its shape. Objects can have multiple types of contrast, which is often how you make more dynamic and interesting visuals.
The image below shows an example of contrast at work.

* The tree's **colors** stand out from its surroundings. While most of the art uses blue and less saturated colors, the tree uses greens, yellows, and reds that stand out.
* While most of the art is dark, the tree and the ground around it have **brighter values**. The snow near the tree is noticeably brighter for instance, making it feel like there's a spotlight on the tree.
* The **lines** here aren't incredibly explicit, but they still exist. Anywhere that there's a border between shapes, there's technically a line. There are also plenty of lines on the cliff face which help give the rocks details.
* While the **shapes** of the rocks are mostly jagged and angular, the tree uses flowing curves as its shape. This helps it stand out against the environment.
* The lighting helps communicate the **forms** of the tree and environment. The light only hits certain parts of the tree, providing the illusion that light is being blocked in some parts as 3D objects would do.
* The **texture** of the tree leaves and bark differs from that of the snow and rocks.

  Knowing how to use contrast effectively can help you make decoration as good as the image above. However, using contrast effectively requires a bit more nuance.

## Visual Weight

What contrasts more: a white square against a black background, or a black square against a white background? This question reveals an important fact: not all contrast is created equal. Contrasting elements such as color, will have a larger impact on your deco than contrasting others, such as texture.
This idea is the basis of **visual weight** – basically, **how much an object draws attention to itself**. Objects with high visual weight will pull your eyes to them more, the same way heavy objects (like your mom) use more force when moving.
Keep in mind that **visual weight is all relative**. If an object draws lots of attention to itself, it will only feel that way because other objects in its surroundings don't draw as much attention to themselves.

`(Need an image example here)`
Since visual weight is based on the elements of deco, each one provides a way to increase visual weight.


`(Each of these needs an image example)`

* **Value:** The most important way to increase visual weight. Value contrast is the one method that lets you completely maximize contrast (for instance, pure black on pure white). Brighter objects, such as lights, tend to have more visual weight (though this depends on how bright the surroundings are).
* **Proximity:** This is derived from space and form, and is basically how "close" an object feels to you. Objects that feel closer will have more visual weight. Similarly, objects packed closer together will have more visual weight than if they're far apart.
* **Color:** Different colors have more visual weight, which is tied to their local value. For instance, red feels heaviest while yellow feels lightest, and warm colors tend to stand out more than cool ones. Additionally, saturated colors will stand out more.
* **Shape:** Objects with regular shapes, like polygons, will have more weight than ones with irregular shapes. This is likely due to them being easier to recognize as actual objects, in the same way that real words convey more meaning than "afokenof" or "hhhgjhg".
* **Direction:** This is also derived from shape. Objects that appear vertical will stand out more than horizontal ones. Diagonal objects have the most weight, and as such they're used the most for dynamic deco.
* **Edges/Lines:** Objects with thicker lines will appear to have more weight than objects with thinner lines. This is a side effect of proximity as thick lines are often used to convey objects being closer.
* **Proportion:** Larger parts of objects will carry more visual weight than smaller parts.
* **Texture:** Objects with textures will have more visual weight than flat objects without any texture.

## Hierarchy

How you intentionally use visual weight to make some objects more / less important
Focal points / areas
Levels of importance (e.g., big medium small)
